Video Analysis Method Used

Particle data, including velocity, size, and outline, are collected from the artificial intelligent particle identification program in MATLAB. 
Built-in open source functions in the MathWorks image processing toolbox are used. Videos are split into frames and pixels are binarized into logic matrices. 
First, binary morphological operation smoothens the shade consistency of particles and background spaces. 
Each frame converts to rough binary values according to the averaged cutoff threshold, with 0 being background pixel, 1 being particle pixel. 
Then, neighboring particle pixels are categorized into groups defined as potential particles. 
These are given calculated tags of centroid, size (defined as number of pixels), major axis length, and boundary location. 
Potential particlesâ€™ size are compared to a minimum size threshold, removing background white noise and tagging the remaining groups as real particles. 
Finally, minimum change calculations allow automatic tracking on the same particle each frame. 
Defining a centroid lock on the targeted tracking particle in frame 1, the particle with the closest centroid in the next frame is calculated to be the same particle. 
With a loop through all frames and observed pixel-nm conversion, the actual size, location, and velocity of the target particle is found and stored in the result arrays. 
The exact green particle outline is plotted on each frame.

Each .m file is taylored to its matching video by adjusting pixel size tolerance and traced particle tag.
